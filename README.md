Creighton JaySearch Browser Extension is meant to simplify copy and pasting browser information to use within the Creighton library search engine "JaySearch". Simply highligh text from a browser window, right click, and search the Creighton library system in a separate browser window. No opening a new window and copying/pasting, just right click and go! Hope you find this helpful.
